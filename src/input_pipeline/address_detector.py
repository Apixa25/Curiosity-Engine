"""
Direct Address Detector — Determines if the user is talking TO the engine.

Classifies audio transcripts as:
  DIRECT    → User is addressing the engine (wake word or directed speech)
  OVERHEARD → User is talking to someone else, on a phone call, etc.
  SILENCE   → No meaningful speech detected

When DIRECT is detected, extracts the user's actual message after the wake word.

- OVERHEARD: The speaker is talking to someone else, on a phone call, thinking out loud without expecting a response, or the content is clearly part of another conversation.

Most speech that doesn't contain the wake word "Hey Serendipity" is OVERHEARD.
