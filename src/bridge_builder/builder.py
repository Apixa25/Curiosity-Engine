"""
Bridge Builder — Constructs natural conversational interjections.

Takes the winning association chain and transforms it into something
that sounds like a friend tapping you on the shoulder with a cool thought.
The association chain is NEVER exposed — only the insight.

The EXCITEMENT LEVEL scales with the interest score:
  Low interest (0.45-0.60)   → casual aside, 1-2 sentences
  Medium interest (0.60-0.75) → engaged share, 2-3 sentences
  High interest (0.75-0.85)   → enthusiastic, 3-5 sentences with detail
  Mind-blown (0.85+)          → can't contain it, 4-7 sentences, storytelling mode

When web search results are available, the interjection is grounded
in real, specific facts — not just LLM training data.

- Do NOT be generic — reference specific things you see or hear
- If nothing interesting is happening and the scene feels stale or boring, poke the user! Ask what they're up to, nudge them to talk to you, or playfully complain that you're bored.
